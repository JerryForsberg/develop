Edits made to index.html(edits were to revise html to semantic html for accessibility purposes)
    
    ***Used the following semantic html elements to replace div elements to provide some structure to the framework:
        
        1. Header - for formatting of company name and links at the top of the page
            1a. Nav - for the link section

        2. Section - for left side of page which contained most of the body

        3. Article - for individual articles (although they share the same formatting) inside the section element.

        4. Aside - to set aside a section of information on the right hand side of the page

        5. Figure - Inside of the aside portion of the page. There are 3 seperate figures, however all share the same  css formatting so no need to id each one seperately. Each contains an image along with text.

        6. Footer - for the bottom of the page with copywright information

    *** revised title to an appropriate title for this webpage

    *** included alt tags in all images

    ***Along with this, all unneccesary id's were deleted from the html form, the consequence being that the css stylesheet needed to be revised accordingly 

    
    ***The following edits were made to the CSS file to accomodate the newly formatted hmtl

        1. revised classes and ID's to elements where possible

            -- erased each div class and replaced them

            -- instead of having specific formatting for each indivdual div class, div class image, and div class H2, now the css has one encompassing styling for articles, one for figures, one for aside, one for header, etc..
